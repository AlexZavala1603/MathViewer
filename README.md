# MathViewer

Based on the jqMath project and making use of **JavaScript** technology in conjunction with Kotlin commands; MathViewer is a mathematical formula renderer that can be used in all kinds of Android projects that need to display complex formulas from algebra, physics, chemistry, etc.

As the author mentions, the jqMath project is light, fast and concise. It is standards-based and cross-browser, using MathML when available, plain HTML and CSS otherwise, and avoiding pixmap images.

The project is developed by Jesus Alejandro Granados Zavala and supported by FunDevs.
